      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Up until now I have been a hobbiest.  I have been playing on computers my whole life.  I had a personal Dos based computer in my bedroom as a teen, when most people went to the library to get access to a computer.  I was on the BBS before the internet.  When I gained access to the internet, at home, I started building basic html webpages about my interests.  As HTML became more complex I learned how to use the new versions.  When Javascript came out I moved to a UI that would help me hack into java so that I could make it do what I wanted.  Eventually I transitioned into blogging.  Before I was done blogging I had five blogs that linked to eachother seemlessly with a complex menu system.  I am in the coding boot camp because I am eager to take this hobby of mine and turn it into a career.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From & Where I live now</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Utah.  That is where I live now.  Utah is an interesting place with a very polorized population.  People who want to solve all the problems with religion are on one end, and the people who want to solve all the problems with government are on the other end.  Not many people find themselves in the moderate middle, understanding both sides.  But that is where I am.  I have a my own mix of beliefs that I have built up, little bit by little bit.  I like it when I find other people who are more moderate, or other people who are more open minded. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to tinker around on computers and creat things digitally.  I like to garden, it gets me outside enjoying nature.  I like to draw and doodle.  I like to bake and am currently experimenting with nut flours.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I have several android apps and web hosted apps that I want to create.  I would love to have the knowledge and the time to create them.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have been a stay-at-home and homeschooling mom for years.  My oldest daughter is going to college and getting her Associates in Science. My secound daughter is graduating from her charter school soon and she wants to be a programmer.  My third child, a son, is in the highschool rock band.  Now my youngest son is ready to transition to his first charter school.  My years of homeschooling children are over, I need to start making money.  I feel that I will be good at Web Developing because I have tinkered with simular things.  I want to reenter the work fource with a skill instead of starting at some minimum wage job. </p>
